        p We're offering early access to developers while our Developer Program is in beta. This plan will allow you to build, explore, and create on the Azuqua Platform, at no cost.
        p This early access period is limited to non-commercial applications (although we are very happy to discuss what it would take to allow a commercial solution!).
        p Once the early access period is over, our pricing will be changed to our standard $0.14 per hour of FLO utilization. Don't worry, you will be able to keep all existing FLOs you have created during this period of time!
